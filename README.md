# Zomato-Analysis
A data-driven exploration and visualization of restaurant trends using the Zomato dataset. This project aims to extract actionable insights from real-world data about restaurants, cities, cuisines, and customer preferences.

---

## Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns.
- Visualize key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Understand how ratings, cuisines, votes, and pricing vary across cities and restaurants.
